### Introduction

Nowadays, CLIs like Create-T3,have made development setup incredibly easy. However, there are times when we might still want to set up something from scratch to have full control and a deeper understanding of our project’s configuration. That’s why I’m writing these blogs—not only as a reference for you but also for myself—so we can both recall the steps involved in setting up our projects from the ground up.



### Installing and Compiling TypeScript

First, make sure you have a workable folder. Run the following commands to initialize a new project and install TypeScript:

```bash
pnpm init
pnpm add -D typescript
```

Next, test out TypeScript by creating a `.ts` file and writing some code in it:

```bash
mkdir ./src
touch ./src/index.ts
```

In the `index.ts` file, add the following code:

```ts
const a: number = 10;
console.log(a);
```

To be able to run this TypeScript code, we first need to configure our TypeScript configuration file. Head to the terminal and type:

```bash
npx tsc --init
```

You should see the following output:

```json
Created a new tsconfig.json with:
  target: es2016
  module: commonjs
  strict: true
  esModuleInterop: true
  skipLibCheck: true
  forceConsistentCasingInFileNames: true

You can learn more at https://aka.ms/tsconfig
```

Now, you can edit the `tsconfig.json` file according to your preferences. Check out what each field does in the [TypeScript: TSConfig Reference - Docs on every TSConfig option](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/). 

For minimal tweaking, change and add the following in `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ESNext",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "outDir": "dist"
  },
  "include": ["./src/**/*"]
}
```

Next, add a script in the `package.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "tsc"
}
```

Now, in the terminal, run:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This will compile the TypeScript files into CommonJS format in the `dist` directory. You can now view the compiled code in the `dist/index.js` file:

```js
"use strict";

const a = 10;

console.log(a);
```
