# Setting up local Postgres database using docker and drizzle in Nextjs

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure Docker is installed and configured on your system.
2. Set up a Next.js project.
3. Basic familiarity with Docker and Next.js.

## Introduction

Hey everyone! Running a database locally during development is essential for an efficient workflow. One of the best ways to achieve this is by using a Docker container. In this blog, we'll explore how to set up a local PostgreSQL environment using Docker and connect it with a Next.js application using Drizzle ORM.

Running a database locally using Docker offers many advantages:

1. **Portability**: Docker containers ensure consistent database environments across different systems.
2. **Isolation**: Docker containers provide isolated environments for PostgreSQL databases, avoiding conflicts with other software installed on your machine.
3. **Ease of Use**: Docker simplifies the setup process, making it easy to start, stop, and manage PostgreSQL instances.

## Project Tree

## Step 1: Create a Docker Compose File

In the root directory of the project, run:
```bash
touch docker-compose.yml
```
Open the file and add the following lines of code to create a bare-bones PostgreSQL container:
```yaml
version: "3.9"

services:
  postgres:
    container_name: postgres_container
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      PGDATA: /data/postgres
    volumes:
      - postgres:/data/postgres
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    networks:
      - postgres
    restart: unless-stopped

networks:
  postgres:
    driver: bridge
```
In this file, we're creating a PostgreSQL container using the `postgres` image from Docker Hub. We're passing some environment variables, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `PGDATA`, and using volumes to make the data persist over reloads and restarts. We're also providing a port.

After setting up this file, go back to your terminal and run:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see:

And yeah, the database is set up!

## Step 2: Connect to an ORM

This step can differ based on the ORM of your choice. If you're unfamiliar with ORMs, they're basically **Object-Relational Mappers**. An ORM allows you to interact with your database using an object-oriented paradigm rather than writing raw SQL queries. It translates data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages and relational databases.

In this project, we'll be using Drizzle. So, head out to the [Drizzle Docs](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started-postgresql#postgresjs) and install the dependencies:
```bash
pnpm add drizzle-orm postgres
pnpm add -D drizzle-kit
```
Next, in the `app` directory, create a folder `server` and inside it, create a `index.ts` and a `schema.ts`:
```bash
cd app
mkdir server && cd server && touch index.ts schema.ts
```
Inside the `index.ts`, add:
```ts
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/postgres-js";
import postgres from "postgres";
import { env } from "~/env";
import * as schema from "./schema";

// creating a global object that has a property `conn` of type `postgres.Sql`

const globalForDb = globalThis as unknown as {
  conn: postgres.Sql | undefined;
};

// if a connection doesn't exist, we're creating a new connection using the PostgreSQL client
const conn = globalForDb.conn ?? postgres(env.DATABASE_URL);

// reusing database connection in production
if (env.NODE_ENV !== "production") globalForDb.conn = conn;

// initializing the Drizzle ORM with the established connection and the schema definitions

export const db = drizzle(conn, { schema });
```
This code sets up and exports a reusable database connection using Drizzle ORM and a PostgreSQL client.

In the `schema.ts` file, add a simple schema for testing:
```ts
import { pgTable, serial } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";
export const post = pgTable("post", {
  id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
});
```
Also, create a file `drizzle.config.ts` and add the following block of code:
```ts
import { env } from "@/env";
import { defineConfig } from "drizzle-kit";

export default defineConfig({
  schema: "./src/server/schema.ts",
  dialect: "postgresql",
  dbCredentials: {
    url: env.DATABASE_URL,
  },
  verbose: true,
  strict: true,
});
```
## Setting up env.ts for type-safe env

Add this package:
```bash
pnpm add @t3-oss/env-nextjs
```
We're using this package so that we can only pass type-safe environmental variables in our project. This utilizes Zod for the type safety.

Create a file `env.ts` in the `app` folder:
```ts
import { createEnv } from "@t3-oss/env-nextjs";
import { z } from "zod";
export const env = createEnv({
  server: {
    DATABASE_URL: z.string().url(),
    NODE_ENV: z.string().min(1),
  },
  client: {},
  runtimeEnv: {
    NODE_ENV: process.env.NODE_ENV,
    DATABASE_URL: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  },
});
```
## Setup .env

In the `.env` file, add a `DATABASE_URL` in our case, it should be:
```ts
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/postgres"
```
## Testing

First, verify whether the PostgreSQL container is running:
```bash
docker ps
```
In the `package.json` file, add the following scripts:
```json
"db:push": "drizzle-kit push",
"db:studio": "drizzle-kit studio",
```
Save all the changes and open the terminal and run:
```bash
pnpm run db:push
```
![push](/dbpush.png)
```bash
pnpm run db:studio
```
![studio](/dbstudio.png)

In the browser, open [Drizzle Studio](https://local.drizzle.studio/) and verify whether the `post` table was created. If so, you have just created a Dockerized PostgreSQL instance and successfully connected it with your Next.js project.
